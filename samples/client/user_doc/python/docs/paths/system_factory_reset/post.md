## Security

Set auth info by setting ApiConfiguration.security_scheme_info to a dict where the
key is the below security scheme quoted name, and the value is an instance of the linked
component security scheme class.
Select the security index by setting ApiConfiguration.security_index_info or by
passing in security_index into the endpoint method.
See how to do this in the code sample.
- these securities are specific to this to this endpoint

| Security Index | Security Scheme to Scope Names |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0       | ["basic"](../../components/security_schemes/security_scheme_basic.md) []<br> |

## Servers

Set the available servers by defining your used servers in ApiConfiguration.server_info
Then select your server by setting a server index in ApiConfiguration.server_index_info or by
passing server_index in to the endpoint method.
- these servers are the general api servers
- defaults to server_index=0, server.url = https://nethsmdemo.nitrokey.com/api/v1

server_index | Class | Description
------------ | ----- | ------------
0 | [Server0](../../servers/server_0.md) |

## Code Sample

```python
import some_api
from some_api.configurations import api_configuration
from some_api.apis.tags import default_api
from pprint import pprint
# security_index 0
from some_api.components.security_schemes import security_scheme_basic

# security_scheme_info for security_index 0
security_scheme_info: api_configuration.SecuritySchemeInfo = {
    "basic": security_scheme_basic.Basic(
        user_id='someUserIdOrName',
        password='somePassword',
    ),
}

used_configuration = api_configuration.ApiConfiguration(
    security_scheme_info=security_scheme_info,
)
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with some_api.ApiClient(used_configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = default_api.DefaultApi(api_client)

    # example, this endpoint has no required or optional parameters
    try:
        api_response = api_instance.system_factory_reset_post()
        pprint(api_response)
    except some_api.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling DefaultApi->system_factory_reset_post: %s\n" % e)
